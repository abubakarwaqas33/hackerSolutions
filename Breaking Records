# Maria plays n games of college basketball in a season. Because 
# she wants to go pro, she tracks her points scored per game 
# sequentially in an array defined as score = [s0, s1, ..., sn-1]. 
# After each game i, she checks to see if score Si breaks her record 
# for most or least points scored so far during that season.

# Given Maria's array of scores for a season of n games, find and print 
# the number of times she breaks her record for most and least points 
# scored during the season.

# Note: Assume her records for most and least points at the start of the 
# season are the number of points scored during the first game of the season.
